                <h2>Tips and Guides</h2>
                <h3>1. How to start with Cat Town?</h3>
                <p>To begin your journey in Cat Town, consider acquiring a cat. 
                   Cats produce floofs, which can be converted into ETH.
                   Additionally, combining floofs can generate more cats for you.</p>
                <h3>2. How can I earn $KIBBLES?</h3>
                <p>You have the opportunity to earn KIBBLE by collecting 3 tickets over 3 consecutive days.
                    Each time you combine or purchase cats, you earn tickets.
                    Remember, tickets can only be claimed once per day, and the daily reset occurs at 8 AM PST.</p>
                <h3>3. How can I take profit?</h3>
                <p>You can profit by selling ETH or combining cats to earn KIBBLE. 
                    Please note that earning KIBBLE is eligible for holders of 100 cats or more.</p>

                <h3>4. But how can I take profit faster?</h3>
                <p>Please remember that investing more can lead to faster earnings. 
                    However, it's important to only invest what you can afford to lose.</p>
                <h3>5. How can I join fishing even I don't have sufficient KIBBLES?</h3>
                <p>Stay active and alert at all times to participate in our community giveaways!</p>
                <h3>6. Can I go offline?</h3>
